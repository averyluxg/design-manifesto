    <h1>To everyone who shapes technology today.</h1>
    <div>We live in a world where technology is <span>consuming</span> society, ethics, and our core existence. </div>
    <p>Time to replace the empty rhetoric of “building a better world”</p>
    <h2>Tech is not above us.</h2>
    <p>Tech is not above us. It should be <span>governed</span> by all of us.</p>
    <h2>Progress is more than innovation.</h2>
    <p>Progress is more than innovation. Let us create a new <span>Renaissance.</span></p>
    <h2>Let us build from trust.</h2>
    <p>Let us build from trust. We need digital citizens, not mere <span>consumers.</span></p>
    <h2>Design open to scrutiny</h2>
    <p>Design open to scrutiny. We must <span>question</span> our intent and listen to our hearts.</p>
    <h2>We must question our intent and listen to our hearts.</h2>
    <p>We must question our intent and listen to our hearts. In the <span>end,</span> our reward will be to know that we have done everything in our power to leave our garden patch a little greener than we found it.</p>
    <h1>We who have signed this letter will hold ourselves and each other accountable for putting these ideas into practice. That is our commitment.</h1>
