    <h1>To everyone who shapes technology today.</h1>
    <div>We live in a world where technology is <span>consuming</span> society, ethics, and our core existence. </div>
    <p>Time to replace the empty rhetoric of “building a better world”</p>
    <p>Tech is not above us. It should be governed by all of us.</p>
    <p>Progress is more than innovation. Let us create a new Renaissance.</p>
    <p>Let us build from trust. We need digital citizens, not mere consumers.</p>
    <p>Design open to scrutiny. We must question our intent and listen to our hearts.</p>
    <p>We must question our intent and listen to our hearts. n the end, our reward will be to know that we have done everything in our power to leave our garden patch a little greener than we found it.</p>
    <p>We who have signed this letter will hold ourselves and each other accountable for putting these ideas into practice. That is our commitment.</p>
